Types of If Statements

1. Simple If
2.

Switch statements:
formant:

switch(xxx)
    case xcan only put integer or string, not boolean, double, etc. :
    default x:
when there is a match, it executes everything after that as well.
Unless you put break; after each case

the equivalent of the else is:

default = when none of the cases are true, you follow this code
make sure to put a break in the case before the default

default doesn't have to be zero, but just make sure you put a break so it
doesn't go into the next

you can combine multiple cases to do the same command
- see switch example

Switch is not useful when you have large ranges, only for static values
